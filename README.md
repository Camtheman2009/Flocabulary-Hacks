# Flocabulary-Hacks (WIP)
by: Lennon Hughes-Simpson

An attempt to make Flocabulary easier with JavaScript bookmarklets

# Instructions

Copy the code in index.js, and make a bookmark using your web browser.
Next, click on the "More..." button when creating the bookmark.
Delete the pre-existing link in the URL box of the bookmark and replace it with the copied code, and done.
Click on the bookmark on the Flocabulary website to run the script, the name can be anything.
Press F to hide menu.

I'm sorry for the issues, the reason the bookmarklet doesn't work is because the bookmarklet is still in development. There is no easy way to make hacks for Flocabulary, and the process for it, which I know, is very difficult. I would do this if I was getting paid, but for now, I don't have time. I suggest using Chat GPT to answer your questions on Flocabulary in the meantime. If you want me to make a bookmarklet that interacts with the Chat GPT api, I will do so. But, keep in mind Chat GPT has a 95% accuracy rate for Flocabulary. This would mean a 100% is not guaranteed. Unlike I-Ready, Flocabulary actually has a decent security system for these sorts of things. I hope you understand.
